## Welcome to DockMCF

By now I would expect most people know what Mincraft is.

Minecraft Forge is a mod framework, which makes building Minecraft modifications (mods) simpler.  To run a Forge mod, your server must also have Forge running on it, so this project aims to provide a containerized version of a Forge server to make testing and deploying your mods faster and easier.

### Minecraft Resources

To learn more about Minecraft, or to download it, visit the official [Minecraft website] (https://minecraft.net).

### Forge

You can get more information about Minecraft Forge from their [official website] (https://files.minecraftforge.net/).

Visit the [Forge documentation site] (http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more about how to manage and run a Forge server, or to use the Forge client.  

To play a Forge modded server, your client must also have the Forge package installed.  Good information can be found on the README of the [Forge project] (https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.12.x/README.md).

### Geting Started

Well, if you read to the bottom of this file, then you just did!

Now, your next step might be to install forge on your client, or to download this project and launch your own Forge server.  Be sure to configure your mod(s) selection and config file to your preference.
